# wcci-fullStackReviewSite

This is my first exploration of Spring JPA. It is a reviews site simulating an online wine vendor. On the back end are three objects and repositories for each: Wine, Review, and Region. Each Wine created comes from a region, and each wine can have multiple reviews attached. On the front end, links to each wine can be viewed first as one full list, or if the user prefers, the user can view the list of all wine-making regions from which the wines are made. Click on any one region, and the next page displays the specific wines available from that region. Clicking on any one wine from any of the pages takes the user to the reviews page for that specific wine.
